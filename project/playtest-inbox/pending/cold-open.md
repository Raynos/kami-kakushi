# Playtest bucket — cold open

- **bucket:** `cold-open`
- **details + screenshots:** `./cold-open/` (`<stamp>.json` = save + logs +
  context, committed; `<stamp>.png` = screenshot, git-ignored)

Each `##` block below is one in-game capture in this bucket, appended in order —
possibly across sessions and builds. Each entry names its kind and records its own
save + context in the linked `<stamp>.json`; reproduce any one with `__qa.load(<its save>)`.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:36:21+0200 — the-new-section-renders

The new section renders in determinitely I think the new section needs more consistent here. 

I also think new can stick around for longer, like fade out after 30s or something.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:37:24+0200 — continue-button-feels-placed

Continue button feels placed a bit small and off center, I think we can add more whitespace, lower it a bit and center it a bit better.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:37:43+0200 — also-i-think-the

Also i think the continue button can be a bit larger, and font size a bit larger.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:38:17+0200 — the-cold-open-changed

The cold open changed, completely, the Memory section is gone, the discussion with genemon is gone, the ability to choose 3 perks is gone.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:38:45+0200 — when-the-cold-open

When the cold open finished, the Progress did not have an unread symbol, it needs to have an unread symbol.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:39:11+0200 — the-text-color-of

The text color of the narrator text is the same as the main character here, like the narrator text color in the cold open VN and the log panel are not consistent with each other.

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:39:59+0200 — i-want-all-speech

I want all speech to stand out a bit more then the narrator text, other then fixing the narrator text color, can you indent the lines that are character speech with margin left or padding left by like 5px or 10px

## Bug · 2026-07-10T11:40:40+0200 — this-flavor-text-is

This flavor text is specific to the intro of the game, and it shows here in the log panel instead of the cold open

But its still main story, can we for this introduction before <auto> button unlocks in the UI do a specific long cooldown on the Rake the spilled rice action

So we can time how long it takes for this text to render with geneemon, the two pieces of flavor text coming form the firest rake the spilled rice button and then do a custom extended cooldown for the first action.

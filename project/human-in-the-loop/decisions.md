# Decisions & questions (HD-items)

**Open** design forks and questions only the human can close. IDs `HD-1…Hn`, never reused.
Status: 🔲 open · ⏳ waiting on Claude prep. (Closed items move to the archive — see below.)
`⛔ blocks <task>` marks a blocker.

> **Rung-tagged (2026-07-09)** — like [`review.md`](review.md), an open HD-item carries a
> `[rung]` tag (or `[cross-cutting]`) for the rung it concerns, so decisions track a
> rung-by-rung pass. _(Currently no open decisions — see below.)_

## Lifecycle (where a resolved HD-item goes)

1. The human answers (inline or in chat); mark it ✅ with the verdict.
2. **Graduate it:** a decision future-us needs the *rationale* for becomes an **ADR** in
   [`../../docs/living/decisions.md`](../../docs/living/decisions.md). A purely **mechanical / structural**
   item (e.g. a file split) skips the ADR — recording a no-op as an ADR only dilutes the log.
3. **Archive it:** add a one-line row to [`archive.md`](archive.md) (H# → ADR + date + intent link) and
   **remove it from this file** so this list stays open-items-only (it's what the session-brief hook scrapes).
4. Capture verbatim intent in [`../feedback-human/`](../feedback-human) and apply the decision to code/docs.

> Closed HD-items: [`archive.md`](archive.md). The ADR log (the durable "why"):
> [`../../docs/living/decisions.md`](../../docs/living/decisions.md).

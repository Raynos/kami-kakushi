# Story take-sets (ADR-139) — open narrative diverges

One directory per **open** narrative-diverge bundle. Canon (`../*.md`) carries
ONLY the picked take; this area holds the **not-picked alternates** the human
compares in-game (DEV panel → Story) until sign-off. On sign-off the bundle's
directory is **deleted** — the committed review doc is the archive.

## Layout

```
takes/<bundle-id>/
  bundle.md     # bundle meta: title, review-doc path, rationale, take list
  take-b.md     # one file per alternate take — standard FB-5 grammar
  take-c.md
```

### bundle.md

```markdown
# bundle <id> · <title>
review: <repo-relative path of the bundle's review doc>
rationale: <one line — why the canon take was picked>

## take b · <label>
brief: <the take's dramatic brief — what it commits to>
scorecard: <compressed Pass-2 verdict, e.g. 18✔ 2✘ 1—>
file: take-b.md
```

Take files use the exact grammar of the sibling canon files
([`../README.md`](../README.md)) and are parsed/emitted by the same compiler
(`pnpm run gen:narrative` → `src/ui/storyTakes.gen.ts`, byte-compared by the
`gen-narrative` gate).

**THE RULE (human, 2026-07-07): every narrative diverge is reviewed in the DEV
menu — the Story switcher is the ONE review surface; a doc-only review is not a
review.** If a unit type can't swap yet, wiring its swap is PART of the diverge,
not optional. Live unit types (ADR-143):

- **rung beats / intro scenes** — render-time substitution (`dev.subRungScene`
  / `dev.subIntroScene`).
- **UI flavor lines** (`## prose flavor`) — render-time (`dev.subFlavor`, live
  on the weapon-card etc.).
- **requirement-completion lines** (`## prose req-flavor`, keyed by requirement
  id — FB-121) — swapped in the CORE via the declaring-module DEV setter
  (`__setRequirementFlavorOverride`, the balance-cockpit lever pattern):
  **future emissions** voice the selected take; already-logged lines stay (T2 —
  history never rewrites). Load a fixture, pick the take, play a completion.
- Dialogue + cold-open keyed prose have no swap yet — diverging one means
  building its swap FIRST (core-emitted text follows the req-flavor pattern;
  render-read text follows subFlavor).

## Rules

- **State-compatible, always.** A take substitutes what the player READS —
  never what the game DOES. Decision option `id`s, `flags:`, `memory:`,
  `bonus:`/`stance:` effects must be IDENTICAL to the canon scene's; only
  prose (greetings, reacts, labels, topics' answers) varies. Swapping takes
  in DEV must never fork state or the RNG stream.
- **The picked take is never duplicated here** — it lives in canon; the DEV
  surfaces render it from the live registries.
- **Prune on sign-off** — delete the bundle dir + regenerate; an empty
  `takes/` means nothing is awaiting story review.

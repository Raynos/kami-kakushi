/** Bumped only on a breaking save-schema change; additive growth needs no bump (PRD §6.8.2).
 *  v2 = the 6-tier reshape (ADR-048): adds `tier` + `influence` (the macro spine).
 *  v3 = the interactive intro: adds `npcMemory` (per-NPC memory) + `introBeat` (the intro cursor).
 *  v4 = the NPC dialogue TREE: adds `askedTopics` (the ask-hub dim/gate set); `introBeat` carries
 *  over unchanged (scene order == old beat order).
 *  v5 = the RICE/COIN/KOKU economy re-core (ADR-107): renames the carried+banked `koku` resource key
 *  to `coin` (the spendable currency) and adds `rice` (a real resource); koku leaves `resources`
 *  entirely (it is now House STANDING, in `influence`).
 *  v6 = the rung-up STORY BEAT (ADR-110): adds `rungBeat` (the active rung beat's target rank, or
 *  null). Additive — an in-flight save defaults it inert (a ready promotion just shows the header
 *  affordance on load; an already-promoted save is unaffected).
 *  v7 = DEEP HOUSING (ADR-111 / FB-89): adds `belongings` (the ids of BOUGHT comfort furniture for the
 *  home). Additive — an old save defaults it `[]` (owns no furniture; the granted mat + bowl are
 *  derived from the home surface, not stored, so they back-reveal for any R1+ save).
 *  v9 = EMERGENT NODE DISCOVERY (ADR-146): adds the `discovered` write-once latch +
 *  `discoveryProgress` attempt counters, and the `discovery` RNG stream cursor. Additive — an old
 *  save has found nothing yet (both default empty; the cursor hydrates 0).
 *  v10 = THE STORYWAVE T0 REWRITE (ADR-150 wave, game plan G1): the six-season MANUAL
 *  calendar (stored `season`/`seasonsPassed`), rice as measured kura-units + per-site
 *  production pools, and the CLEAN BREAK — this is a new APP_GENERATION, so a
 *  pre-generation blob RETIRES (courteous notice + backup) rather than migrating
 *  (ADR-161). MIGRATIONS 1–9 are deleted; the chain restarts empty at v10.
 *  Pre-launch dev saves are wiped (ADR-067), but each forward step is a real, test-covered chain.
 *  v11 = DERIVED REVEAL (ADR-179): the stored `unlocked` visibility latch is DELETED — visibility
 *  derives from progression facts (core/unlock visibleSet); the new `seenReveals` announce-once
 *  ceremony latch is seeded from the old field (plus a `coin-earned` fact-flag where the old
 *  latch is the only record of a first wage).
 *  v14 = MERCHANT STATE (ADR-194): additive `merchants` map (purse + stock per merchant) —
 *  an absent field hydrates to the seeded roster on load (validate), so the migration is
 *  the identity; the bump records the format change.
 *  v15 = ASK HEARD-STATE (FB-415): additive `asksHeard` map (askId → freshness key) —
 *  an absent field hydrates to `{}` on load (validate — no ask heard yet, the correct
 *  fresh default), so the migration is the identity; the bump records the format change.
 *  v16 = THE RUN RECORD (ADR-201, stamp book): additive `rungRecord` (dated rung presses)
 *  + `defeatDays` (dated falls). Absent fields hydrate to `[]` — old saves' pressed set
 *  still derives from the rank-rN flags, their seals just render undated — so the
 *  migration is the identity; the bump records the format change. */

// A bundle = one OPEN narrative diverge: its not-picked alternate takes, kept
// DEV-only so the human can compare them in the running game (the story
// set-switcher + the script-reader modal in the DEV panel). The picked take
// lives in canon; on sign-off the bundle's source dir is pruned and the
// committed review doc remains the archive.
//
// This module is imported ONLY from the `__DEV_TOOLS__`-gated dev fold
// (src/ui/dev.ts) — never by the pure core or the plain renderer — so in a
// strip build it dead-code-eliminates with the rest of the DEV panel.
// Source of truth: `src/core/content/narrative/takes/<bundle>/` →
// `pnpm run gen:narrative` → `storyTakes.gen.ts` (byte-compared by the gate).

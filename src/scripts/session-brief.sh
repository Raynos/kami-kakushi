# Wired into the SessionStart hook (.claude/settings.json) so every cold pickup
# surfaces what's waiting on the human WITHOUT being asked:
#   1. human TODOs        (project/todo-human.md ## TODO — unticked tasks)
#   2. the reading queue  (project/todo-human.md ## Reading queue — unticked sign-offs)
#   3. pending PRD changes (project/status/pending-prd-changes.md — locked canon not yet applied)
#   4. open decisions     (project/human-in-the-loop/decisions.md — H-items)
#   5. open reviews       (project/human-in-the-loop/review.md — R-items)
# ...then a "what to DO next" nudge so a cold pickup knows where the work lives:
#   6. next autonomous work — NOT a maintained list. Just points at the sources
#      that are ALREADY kept current (the active plan(s), project-status.md, the
#      latest journal) and asks the agent to name the startable workstream(s) —
#      OFTEN JUST ONE (the active plan); "up to 3" is a cap for genuinely-parallel
#      work, not a quota to pad to. This must be FAST (≤5s): the agent relays
#      THIS output with ZERO tool calls — every signal it needs (queue, reviews,
#      commits, active-plan tag) is already inlined below. Even one git/Read/verify
#      round-trip costs several seconds and blows the budget; the deeper
#      verify-against-git check is for when the work is PICKED UP, not the brief.
#      No new file to keep in sync; the script names the current files so the agent
#      doesn't have to hunt — but it must NOT open them just to brief.
#
# Output goes to stdout, which the SessionStart hook injects into Claude's context
# (so the agent can lead the session by relaying the brief). NOTE: a SessionStart
# hook's output is NOT painted into the TUI scrollback on success — stdout feeds the
# model's context, and stderr is only visible in transcript mode (Ctrl-R). So the
# brief surfaces via the agent's first reply, not on its own. Run it by hand any
# time to see it directly: `bash src/scripts/session-brief.sh`.
# Pure read — never mutates state.
